Good news for eager bargain hunters: Plenty of online retailers are willing to slash prices in order to attract your business. To find these discounts, head to price comparison sites such as Google Shopping and PriceGrabber, which will list where something is selling for the cheapest price. Before you start your purchase though, check to see how extras like shipping charges and warranty costs will add to your total cost.
Don't forget the biggest online retail behemoth out there. This guide to saving time and money on Amazon has lots of useful advice, such as tracking price changes with CamelCamelCamel. Plenty of the tips apply to other sites as well. For example, sign up for the email newsletters and follow the social media accounts of your favorite stores in order to receive a heads up on special tech deals you wouldn't otherwise notice.The time you shop can make a difference to the price you pay. So if you can hold off on a purchase, you might be able to get it for cheaper. For example, the sales bonanza that kicks off with Black Friday doesn't really stop until Christmas. The biggest reductions during this period will be on older, mid-range tech rather than the very top-end stuff, so by all means splurge, but make sure you know what you're getting.
When should you buy to get discounts on the best and newest gadgets? These deals don't usually hit the scene until immediately before or after an updated version arrives. If you wait for the new model to appear, the current (and soon to be "old" model) is likely to be much cheaper. For the iPhone, for instance, shop in September, while Samsung's Galaxy phones get less expensive around late February or early March, coinciding with the Mobile World Congress tech expo.
